**FoldQuantVLA: Native Low-Bit Quantization of Vision-Language-Action Models
via Consistent Folding**

W8A8 and W4A4 quantization of vision-language-action (VLA) models, executed
natively on the device's INT8 / INT4 tensor cores (not simulated), via
**consistent offline folding**.

Paper: [arXiv 2609.24433](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.24433). Reproduce: [Results](#results).

## Highlights

- **Consistent folding.** One transform per shared activation site, a SmoothQuant scale composed with a block rotation, is fixed at calibration, folded into every consuming weight before GPTQ rounding, and applied at runtime as one fused prologue. Calibration, rounding and execution therefore share one coordinate system.
- **Native low-bit kernels.** TensorRT plugins on CUTLASS integer GEMMs run W8A8 and W4A4 projections on the integer tensor cores of both the language backbone and the action expert. Four-bit is native INT4 on Ada (sm_89) and Jetson AGX Orin (sm_87); H100 lowers four-bit operands to its INT8 datapath.
- **Selective INT8.** Holding `o_proj` and `down_proj` at INT8 inside a W4A4 tower improves held-out action fidelity on all four checkpoints for a checkpoint-dependent latency cost (about 1 ms on GR00T N1.7 on Orin). The paper reports its closed-loop and real-robot results.
- **Four VLA releases, one build path.** GR00T N1.5 / N1.6 / N1.7 and π₀.₅ keep their upstream code, evaluation harness and policy server; float, W8A8 and W4A4 engines come off the same `export → build → install` path and differ only in projection precision.

## How it works

Only the projection GEMMs change precision. The vision encoder and the decoder
stay floating point; the language backbone and the action expert run INT8 or
INT4, and the expert's denoising loop reuses one engine for every step.

The GR00T DiT and π₀.₅ expert use shared plugin kernels through separate
emitters. LLM backbones use the INT8 per-row path (`w8a8_sr`) or the INT4
path (`w4a4_srg`) with the same weight contract.

The repository contains the shared [`foldquant`](foldquant) package and
pinned upstream releases under `models/<family>/`. Each release adds a
`foldquant_integration/` adapter for export and runtime installation.

| family | upstream | integration | support |
|---|---|---|---|
| GR00T N1.7 | NVIDIA Isaac GR00T, `n1.7-release` (`23ace64f`) | [`models/groot_n1_7`](models/groot_n1_7/foldquant_integration/README.md) | ✓ |
| GR00T N1.6 | NVIDIA Isaac GR00T, `n1.6.1-release` (`5dc80c4a`) | [`models/groot_n1_6`](models/groot_n1_6/foldquant_integration/README.md) | ✓ |
| GR00T N1.5 | NVIDIA Isaac GR00T, `n1.5-release` (`4af2b622`) | [`models/groot_n1_5`](models/groot_n1_5/foldquant_integration/README.md) | ✓ |
| π₀.₅ | openpi, `main` (`215abfb2`) | [`models/pi05`](models/pi05/foldquant_integration/README.md) | ✓ |

Support covers export, engine build, held-out drift, latency, LIBERO, and
policy serving. GR00T runs LIBERO in process; π₀.₅ uses a separate upstream
client environment and a running policy server.

[`results/`](results) holds the held-out drift and desktop latency records
for the W8A8 and W4A4 arms; every table, the protocol and the LIBERO and
Jetson figures are in the paper.

## Schemes

A scheme key is `w{W}a{A}` followed by its folds, one letter per pass in a
fixed order: `s` SmoothQuant scale, then a rotation, then `g` GPTQ rounding. On
the action expert `r` is a learned dense block rotation (the matrix ships with
the engine) and `h` the fixed Sylvester butterfly, applied as an FWHT. On the
LLM backbone `r` is the fixed block Hadamard (block 64), also applied as an
FWHT inside the plugin. `w8a8` alone is the dynamic per-row baseline and folds
nothing.

`float` exports an unquantized engine with the same runtime bindings as the
quantized graph; `none` keeps the module in PyTorch. GR00T N1.7 uses upstream
float graphs through `build_engines --float-onnx-dir`.

Float and quantized engines use strong typing to preserve the graph's declared
dtypes. This keeps the float baseline comparable to the BF16 reference.

| target | schemes | plugin library |
|---|---|---|
| action expert (DiT / expert) | `w4a4_shg` · `w4a4_sh` · `w4a4_sr` · `w8a8_sh` · `w8a8` | `foldquant_int4_per_row` / `foldquant_int8_per_row` |
| LLM backbone | `w8a8_sr` · `w8a8_s` · `w4a4_srg` · `w4a4_sg` · `w4a8_srg` | same, by activation width |
| W4A16 baseline | ModelOpt AWQ groupwise | `foldquant_int4_groupwise` |

[`foldquant/schemes.py`](foldquant/schemes.py) defines supported keys and
modules. GPTQ (`…g`) changes offline weight rounding while retaining the same
runtime kernel, node attributes, and byte layout.

### Selective INT8 inside a W4A4 tower

A W4A4 language tower can hold chosen projection sites at INT8 with
`site_bits`, passed through `--llm-params`:

```bash
--llm-scheme w4a4_srg --llm-params '{"site_bits": {"o": 8, "down": 8}}'
```

Valid sites are `qkv`, `o`, `gateup`, and `down`. Keeping `o_proj` and
`down_proj` at INT8 improves action cosine over uniform W4A4 while retaining
integer GEMMs at every projection. These sites have no preceding learned gain
for scale folding. The paper measures this arm on every checkpoint.

  kernels/            TensorRT plugin sources (CUDA + CUTLASS), locator, build CLI

```

## Install

Each model directory pins its own environment (Python, torch, TensorRT); the
`foldquant` package installs into it:

```bash
git submodule update --init third_party/cutlass
cd models/groot_n1_7
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e ../..
python -m foldquant.kernels build      # compiles the plugin .so for this GPU / TensorRT
python -m foldquant.kernels status
```

Each integration README lists the family's environment (GR00T N1.6 / N1.5 pin
older torch and flash-attn wheels; openpi pins Python 3.11 and copies its
patched `transformers` files over the installed package) and its LIBERO
submodule (`models/groot_n1_{7,6}/external_dependencies/LIBERO`,
`models/pi05/third_party/libero`; N1.5 pins none, so its README points at
upstream's install steps).

Kernels build with `nvcc`, the CUTLASS submodule and the vendored TensorRT
headers. Binaries are cached per `(SM, machine, TensorRT major.minor)` under
`~/.cache/foldquant` with device and version checks at load. From the repository
root, install the development dependencies and run the unit tests:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest tests -q
```

Then follow the family's integration README, e.g.
[GR00T N1.7](models/groot_n1_7/foldquant_integration/README.md): float
export/engines with the upstream pipeline → `export_foldquant` → `build_engines`
→ `verify` / `eval_libero` / `benchmark`.

## Results

[`results/`](results) holds the records behind the paper's held-out drift and
desktop latency tables: `results/<family>/<arm>/verify.json` (32 held-out
observations, per-observation cosines) for the `w8a8` and `w4a4` arms, and
`results/<family>/benchmark.json` (or `results/groot_n1_7/<arm>/benchmark.log`)
for latency on an RTX 4070 Ti SUPER. Without a GPU:

```bash
python scripts/check_records.py               # the invariants every record must satisfy
python scripts/results_tables.py              # the drift (protocol P2) and latency tables
```

### Reproduce the paper's LIBERO campaign (protocol P3)

Four suites, ten tasks each, episode `i` of every task from LIBERO's stored
initial state `i` (`i = 0..19`), ten no-op settle steps, 520 environment
steps, eight actions executed per policy call (five on π₀.₅), terminate on
success: 800 episodes per arm. Build the arm with the family's integration
README, then:

```bash
# GR00T N1.7 / N1.6, from models/groot_n1_7 or models/groot_n1_6
MUJOCO_GL=egl python -m foldquant_integration.eval_libero --protocol p3 \
    --model-path <checkpoint> --engine-dir exports/<arm>/engines --output <out>
# GR00T N1.5, from models/groot_n1_5
MUJOCO_GL=egl python -m foldquant_integration.eval_libero --protocol p3 \
    --model-path <checkpoint> --embodiment-tag new_embodiment --denoising-steps 8 \
    --engine-dir exports/<arm>/engines --output <out>
# π₀.₅, from models/pi05 (the client runs in examples/libero/.venv)
MUJOCO_GL=egl python -m foldquant_integration.eval_libero --protocol p3 \
    --checkpoint-dir <checkpoint> --engine-dir exports/<arm>/engines \
    --client-python examples/libero/.venv/bin/python --output <out>
```

Omit `--engine-dir` for the BF16 PyTorch arm. `<out>/summary.json` records
every episode's initial state and outcome, resumes an interrupted sweep only
into the same checkpoint, engines and protocol (`--no-resume` starts over),
and pools success over episodes. Flow-matching noise is not seeded at serve
time, so a rerun reproduces the protocol, not each episode; the paper's paired
tests at this size do not separate the arms. `--protocol p3
--max-episode-steps 720` on the NVIDIA per-suite N1.7 checkpoints is the
paper's Table I setting.

`scripts/smoke_family.sh`, `scripts/smoke_serve.sh` and `scripts/smoke_eval.sh`
check that export → build → verify, the policy server, and one LIBERO episode
per task run end to end; they say nothing about a published number.

## Deploying

Engines install into the **upstream release's own policy server**, so an
unmodified upstream client drives a quantized policy by changing a host and a
port. Each family's repository documents its client and real-robot examples.

Quantization changes the arithmetic, not the policy: an engine built from a
LIBERO checkpoint emits LIBERO actions on any robot, so a real deployment
starts from a checkpoint fine-tuned for that embodiment.

[`docs/deploy/jetson.md`](docs/deploy/jetson.md) covers the edge target the
paper measures: the plugin library and the engines are built on the board
(neither is portable across `(SM, TensorRT)`), while ONNX crosses from a
workstation.
[`docs/deploy/jetson_serve.md`](docs/deploy/jetson_serve.md) builds and serves
GR00T N1.7 entirely on an Orin, step by step or through
[`scripts/deploy_groot_n17_jetson.sh`](scripts/deploy_groot_n17_jetson.sh).
