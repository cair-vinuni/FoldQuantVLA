"""Turn a caller's local path into something a committed result may carry.

Every integration records what an arm was built from — the checkpoint, the
calibration dataset, the engine directory — into ``foldquant_export.json`` and
``verify.json``, and those files are committed under ``results/``. Written
verbatim they publish the operator's filesystem: ``/home/<user>/...`` names a
person, and an absolute path names a machine layout nobody else can use.

The reduction is not simply a basename, because a basename throws away the one
thing the field is for. A Hugging Face cache directory carries the repository
in its own name (``models--ORG--NAME/snapshots/<sha>``), so it becomes
``ORG/NAME`` — shorter, anonymous, and still the identifier a reader can
resolve. Anything else absolute keeps its last component, which is what the
operator called the checkpoint.

Hub ids and repository-relative paths are left exactly as they are: they are
already portable and already public, and rewriting them would lose provenance
for no privacy gain.
