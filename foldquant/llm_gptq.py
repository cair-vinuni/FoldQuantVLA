"""GPTQ weight rounding for LLM W4A4 plugins.

The kernel supports one scale per output row. GPTQ preserves that scale and
distributes each column's rounding error across unquantized columns using
the inverse Hessian. Groupwise scales are not supported.

The Hessian must use the transformed activation ``rot(x / s)`` because weights
are quantized after SmoothQuant and Hadamard folding. Torch is imported lazily;
this module does not load TensorRT or plugin libraries.
