"""FoldQuant rotation + INT4 packing for the W4A4 DiT macro plugins.

These reproduce, byte-for-byte, the weight preprocessing the compiled
``foldquant_int4_per_row`` plugins expect in their ``PluginField`` attributes:

  * a composite **SVD·Hadamard input rotation** per weight (``build_rotation`` +
    ``apply_weight_rotation``), stored as a channel permutation ``perm`` (int32)
    and a per-block orthogonal matrix stack ``R`` (BF16);
  * **column-major INT4** packing of the rotated weight (``pack_int4_colmajor``),
    matching CUTLASS ``ColumnMajor int4b_t`` (see ``dit_int4_rowwise.h``);
  * an optional **SmoothQuant per-channel activation fold** (``fold_rotation_sq``
    / ``pack_int4_colmajor_sq``) that absorbs a static per-channel activation
    scale into the rotation and weight — deployable static W4A4;
  * the ``AdaLNModInt4`` weight-only GEMV packing (``adaln_pack_int4``).

Reproduced verbatim from the GR00T FoldQuant reference; the math must not drift from
the kernels. Torch is imported lazily (offline, build-time only) so importing
this module stays cheap. No ``tensorrt``/``.so``/``foldquant.runtime`` imports.
