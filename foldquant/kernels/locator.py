"""Resolve and load custom TensorRT plugin ``.so`` for the running device.

A plugin binary is only usable on the device tuple it was compiled for: CUDA SM
arch, machine ABI, and TensorRT minor (the ``IPluginV3`` ABI is tied to the TRT
minor). Committed binaries are named ``<libname>.<target_slug>.so``; a
device-mismatch rebuild is cached out-of-tree as ``<cache>/<slug>/<libname>.so``.

Neutral by design: heavy imports (``torch``/``tensorrt``/``importlib.resources``)
live inside functions, and the committed dir is reached by path navigation from
this package only (``foldquant.kernels``, never the export code),
so importing this module never pulls in build-time code or crosses the
build->runtime boundary.
