"""What each custom kernel is and what it needs to build — the single source of truth.

Before this existed, "which libraries need CUTLASS" was a set literal inside the
build driver, one package away from the sources it described. Nothing tied the
two together, so a kernel could be added with a CUTLASS dependency while the
driver still believed it had none — which is exactly how ``foldquant_int4_per_row``
came to be declared CUTLASS-free while its GEMM includes ``<cutlass/cutlass.h>``.
The failure surfaced as a bare "No such file or directory" mid-compile.

Declaring it here, beside the kernel, means the build driver, the CMake glue and
the environment report all read one answer. ``test_kernel_registry.py`` checks the
declarations against the sources on disk, so a drift fails a test rather than a
build.

This module is import-light and neutral: no torch, no CUDA, no
the export code. Both the runtime loader and the build path read it.
