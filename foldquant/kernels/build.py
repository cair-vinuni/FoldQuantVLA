"""Rebuild the custom TensorRT plugin ``.so`` from vendored source (build-time).

When no committed binary matches the running device, the build path compiles the
kernels under :mod:`foldquant.kernels` for the current CUDA arch into the
out-of-tree cache (never the committed dir). This is build-time only: the runtime
loader (:mod:`foldquant.kernels.locator`) reads committed/cache
``.so`` and never triggers a compile.
