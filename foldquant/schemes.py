"""FoldQuant scheme keys: which fold each name spells, which modules it serves, which plugin library runs it.

A key is ``w{W}a{A}`` followed by the fold it applies, one letter per pass in a
fixed order: ``s`` SmoothQuant scale, then a rotation, then ``g`` GPTQ rounding.
On action modules ``r`` is a learned dense rotation and ``h`` the fixed Sylvester
butterfly; on LLM keys ``r`` is the fixed block-64 Hadamard applied by the
plugin's FWHT (:mod:`.llm_rotation_sq`). ``w8a8`` alone is the dynamic per-row
baseline, which folds nothing and needs no calibration.

Action-module keys (DiT, Pi expert) and LLM keys
are separate vocabularies: the two graph families are different emitters over
different plugin sets, so a key is refused for a module it has no graph for
rather than silently downgraded.
