"""FoldQuant scheme keys: which fold each name spells, which modules it serves, which plugin library runs it.

A key is ``w{W}a{A}`` followed by the fold it applies, one letter per pass in a
fixed order: ``s`` SmoothQuant scale, then ``r`` (learned dense rotation) or ``h``
(fixed Sylvester butterfly), then ``g`` GPTQ rounding. ``w8a8`` alone is the
dynamic per-row baseline, which folds nothing and needs no calibration.

Action-module keys (DiT, Evo-1 action head, SmolVLA / Pi expert) and LLM keys
are separate vocabularies: the two graph families are different emitters over
different plugin sets, so a key is refused for a module it has no graph for
rather than silently downgraded.
