"""Calibration observations through the upstream openpi policy path.

A folded scheme fits SmoothQuant scales and GPTQ Hessians from what it sees,
so FoldQuant samples ``num_samples`` ``(episode, step)`` pairs spread over a
LeRobot dataset and hands each one to ``Policy.infer`` in exactly the shape
upstream's LIBERO client (``examples/libero/main.py``) sends over the wire:
the two 224x224 uint8 camera frames after ``resize_with_pad``, the 8-d
proprioceptive state and the task prompt. The policy's own transforms
(``LiberoInputs`` -> normalise -> tokenise) run inside ``infer`` as at
deployment, so the calibration pass and the served pass see the same tensors.

The dataset is opened with the ``lerobot`` package upstream pins; the frames
come out of its video decoder as the float CHW tensors ``LiberoInputs`` also
accepts, and are turned back into the client's uint8 HWC frames here so that
the resize happens on the same pixels the client resizes.
